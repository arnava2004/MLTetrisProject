# Tetris AI (MDP & Neural Approaches)

This project contains a Tetris-playing agent implemented using both MDP (Markov Decision Process) and Q-learning with neural networks.

## Code Structure

├── __pycache__/         # Python bytecode cache
├── MDP.py               # Core MDP algorithm implementation
├── MDPBlockDrop.py      # MDP simulation for falling blocks
├── TetrisEnv.py         # Tetris environment definition
├── qlnn.py              # Q-learning with neural network
├── run.py               # Main script to run experiments
├── plot.py              # Visualization utilities
├── env.yml              # Conda environment & dependencies

```

## Setup

Install dependencies using `conda`:

```bash
conda env create -f env.yml
conda activate tetris
```

## Running

To train or evaluate models:

```bash
python run.py
```

Or experiment with MDP:

```bash
python MDP.py
```
